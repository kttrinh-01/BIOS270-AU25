## Farmshare Setup

I logged into Farmshare using SSH:

```bash
ssh <SUNetID>@login.farmshare.stanford.edu
```

An SSH key was generated directly on Farmshare to authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<SUNetID>@stanford.edu"
```

The SSH agent was started and the private key was added:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_farmshare_<GitHub_Username>
```

The public key was then added to GitHub, and the connection was verified successfully:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Working Directory

All coursework was completed in the `$SCRATCH` directory on Farmshare:

```bash
export SCRATCH=/farmshare/user_data/<SUNetID>
cd $SCRATCH
```

## HW Part A – Conceptual Questions

### Question 1

**Fill in the blank:**

> "Git provides a **history** of content changes."

---

### Question 2

**Which git command shows the historical graphical representation of branching and merging events?**

```bash
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

This command displays a visual representation of the commit graph, including branches and merges.

## HW Part B – Interactive Git Tutorial

The following exercises on [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) were completed:

* **Introduction Sequence** – 4/4 modules completed
* **Push & Pull — Git Remotes!** – 8/8 modules completed

Screenshots of the “level complete” pages are included below in the submission section.

## HW Part C – GitHub Practice

### Forking and Cloning

The course repository was forked and cloned to Farmshare using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<GitHub_Username>/BIOS270-AU25.git
```

---

### Branching and Editing

A new branch was created for HW1:

```bash
git checkout -b hw1-setup
```

The file `Writeup0.md` was edited to include my **name** and **SUNetID**.

---

### Committing and Pushing

Changes were committed in two logical commits and pushed to the forked repository:

```bash
git commit -m "Update name and SUNetID"
git commit -m "Complete HW1 submission"
git push origin hw1-setup
```

---

### Pull Request

A pull request was opened from `hw1-setup` into my fork’s `main` branch and successfully merged.

The URL of this Markdown file on the `main` branch was submitted to Canvas as required.

---

## HW Part D – Jira (Optional)

A Jira project named **BIOS270** was created using the Kanban template. Jira was connected to GitHub, and a task named **HW1** was created.

A branch containing the task ID was created:

```bash
git checkout -b BIOS-1-hw1
```

Commits and the pull request included the task ID in their messages, allowing Jira to automatically link development activity to the task.

A screenshot showing the PR linked to the Jira task is included in the submission section.
