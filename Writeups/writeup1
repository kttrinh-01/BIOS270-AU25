1. How many SLURM jobs will be submitted?

Answer:
3 SLURM jobs will be submitted.

Explanation:
The directive

#SBATCH --array=0-2


creates a job array with task IDs 0, 1, and 2, meaning SLURM launches three independent array tasks under the same job ID.

2. What is the purpose of the if statement?
if (( i % SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT == SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID )); then
    echo "$i: $value"
fi


Answer:
The if statement assigns specific lines of data.txt to specific SLURM array tasks, effectively distributing the workload across the array.

Explanation:

i is the line index (starting from 0)

SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT = 3

SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID ∈ {0,1,2}

Each line is printed only by the array task whose task ID matches i % 3.
This ensures:

Every line is processed exactly once

The work is split evenly among array jobs

3. What is the expected output in each *.out file?
Contents of data.txt
Index : Value
0 : 12
1 : 7
2 : 91
3 : 8
4 : 27
5 : 30

Task 0 output (*_0.out)

Lines where i % 3 == 0:

0: 12
3: 8

Task 1 output (*_1.out)

Lines where i % 3 == 1:

1: 7
4: 27

Task 2 output (*_2.out)

Lines where i % 3 == 2:

2: 91
5: 30
